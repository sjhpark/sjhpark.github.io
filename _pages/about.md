I am a second-year master's student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). My work and interests primarily focus on multimodal machine learning, self-suprevised learning, on-device machine learning, and model compression for optimizaition and improved efficiency. In general, my research interests revolve around the real-world applications of AI/ML in various fields.

As you navigate through my pages, I suggest you explore the narrative journey into each of my projects and see how it is tightly knitted with my focus and interests. Each of my works has provided a great foundation and practice for building my knowledge and shaping it to apply to real-world applications and challenges. From building a naive human facial emotion classifier to developing a multimodal ML model to estimate pilots' stress levels, it has taken me a good amount of effort and passion, which permeates my work.

      <b>My research primarily focuses on using deep learning-based and multimodal machine learning models to conduct statistical estimators in various fields, such as aviation, autonomous driving, robotics, and biomedical applications.</b> Currently, I am particularly concentrated on building machine learning models to facilitate their usage in the aviation domain, with the hope of contributing to more adaptive flight control, co-pilot, and even air traffic-related systems. Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering, which has been serving as my prior knowledge in this domain.
