<h2>Motivation</h2><br>
With the growing focus on urban air mobility, the development of next-generation air mobility systems has become
a paramount area of research. This project is motivated from a semi-autonomous approach, wherein pilots remain within the aircraft, supported by advanced co-pilot systems to alleviate their workload during flight operations.
To enhance adaptive co-pilot systems, a key aspect is identifying instances when pilots experience high workloads, and one effective
method for workload assessment is analyzing pilots’ eye gaze. 
The instance segmentation approach enables a granular understanding of the pilot’s visual focus, contributing valuable insights into workload distribution during different phases of flight.
